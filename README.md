# Simple database
<H2>Summary of program</H2>
The code is a simple database management system that allows for data entry, retrieval, and modification. The program has two classes login and dataentry. The login class has a function that verifies the entered username and password against the username and password specified in the username.txt and password.txt files respectively. The dataentry class has functions for adding, displaying, retrieving and deleting data from the database.csv file. The main function initializes objects from the two classes and takes inputs from the user to perform different actions such as adding new data to the database, displaying all data, retrieving a specific data entry based on the serial number, or deleting a specific data entry based on the serial number.
<H2>Features</H2>
<UL type = "Dot">
<Li>The program makes use of 3 separate files, the header, function module, and the main file.
<Li>Object oriented programming principles were implemented, and that brought the several benefits of OOP with it.
<Li>The code has several input validation statements that prevent an incorrect input from being entered. This is accomplished through the while loops.
<H2>Lessons Learnt</H2>
A lot of knowledge and experience was gained in the process of the project. Many features of C++, which were previously unknown to me, were implemented in the code to acheive the task in mind.
