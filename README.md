<H1>Simple database</H1>
<H3>Summary of program</H3>
The code is a simple database management system that allows for data entry, retrieval, and modification. The program has two classes login and dataentry. The login class has a function that verifies the entered username and password against the username and password specified in the username.txt and password.txt files respectively. The dataentry class has functions for adding, displaying, retrieving and deleting data from the database.csv file. The main function initializes objects from the two classes and takes inputs from the user to perform different actions such as adding new data to the database, displaying all data, retrieving a specific data entry based on the serial number, or deleting a specific data entry based on the serial number.
<H3>Features</H3>
<UL>
<Li>The program makes use of 3 separate files, the header, function module, and the main file.
<Li>Output data is stored in a Comma Separated Values (csv) file, which can be easily shared and accessed.
<Li>User can perform any of the 4 actions: Adding a data entry, viewing all the data or a specific entry, modifying and deleting a specific data entry.
<Li>Every data entry has a unique ID associated with it, which allows the user to view, modify, and delete a specific data entry.
<Li>Object oriented programming principles were implemented, and that brought the several benefits of OOP with it.
<Li>The code has several input validation statements that prevent an incorrect input from being entered. This is accomplished through while loops.
